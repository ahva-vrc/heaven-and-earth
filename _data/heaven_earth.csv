image8,image8.jpg,Merode altarpiece (Triptych of the Annunciation),"Campin, Robert (c. 1375-1444)",1425-28,c. 1425-28,"Having just entered the room, the angel Gabriel is about to tell the Virgin Mary that she will be the mother of Jesus. The golden rays pouring in through the left oculus carry a miniature figure with a cross. On the right wing, Joseph, who is betrothed to the Virgin, works in his carpenter’s shop, drilling holes in a board. The mousetraps on the bench and in the shop window opening onto the street are thought to allude to references in the writings of Saint Augustine identifying the cross as the devil’s mousetrap. On the left wing, the kneeling donor appears to witness the central scene through the open door. His wife kneels behind him, and a town messenger stands at the garden gate. The owners would have purchased the triptych to use in private prayer. An image of Christ’s conception in an interior not unlike the one in which they lived also may have reinforced their hope for their own children.
One of the most celebrated early Netherlandish paintings—particularly for its detailed observation, rich imagery, and superb condition—this triptych belongs to a group of paintings associated with the Tournai workshop of Robert Campin (ca. 1375–1444), sometimes called the Master of Flémalle. Documents indicate that he hired at least two assistants, the young Rogier van der Weyden (ca. 1400–1464) and Jacques Daret (ca. 1404–1468). Stylistic and technical evidence suggests that the altarpiece was executed in phases. The Annunciation, which follows a slightly earlier workshop composition, probably was not commissioned. Shortly thereafter, the male donor ordered the wings, which appear to have been painted by two artists. At a later point, in the 1430s, presumably following the donor’s marriage, the portraits of his wife and of the messenger were added. The windows of the central panel, originally covered with gold leaf, were painted with a blue sky, and the armorial shields were added afterward.",,"New York City, USA",Metropolitan Museum of Art,image/jpeg,Oil on oak; Dimensions: Overall: 25 3/8 x 46 3/8 in.

Acquired from the Chapel by Mary of Hungary (1505-1558), it was displayed in 1549 in the chapel of her castle at Binche. Mary`s nephew Philip II of Spain placed it before 1564 in the chapel of his palace at El Pardo outside Madrid.Taken to the Escorial in 1566, it remained there until 1939, when it was transferred to the Prado.The shape of the Descent is that commonly used in Brabant for the centrepieces of large winged altarpieces.The projection at the top could have had its own small wings, while the rest could have been protected by rectangular shutters, possibly without imagery.

image11,image11.jpg,Marten Nieuwenhove diptych,Hans Memling (1433-1494),1487,1487,"The painting is an early example of an Early Netherlandish devotional diptych, which still preserves the original frame and hinges. A new invention was showing the scene in a continuous room, instead of against a monochrome background.
The window at the upper left originally was clear glass, showing a landscape. The composition was changed at a later stage to show the coat of arms of Van Nieuwenhove here instead. It was more common to have this on the outer panels than this prominently. It is surrounded by four images of a hand sowing seeds, a pun on the name of the donor which means ""from the new garden"". The same coat of arms can also be seen on the clasp of the book in front of Van Nieuwenhove.
The mirror behind Mary shows the scene in reverse, making it even more explicit that the two panels are placed in the same room and time, even though the actual configuration seen in the mirror does not match the scene in the main painting. Memling only included the mirror in a later stage of the composition. This unity of space was also emphasized by small details like the carpet to the left of Mary, which reappears beneath the hands of van Nieuwenhove. The work was probably intended to be displayed with the two panels at an angle, but it is uncertain how exactly they should be placed. One possibility is that it was intended to be hung from a wall or column, with the Virign panel fixed and the van Nieuwenhove panel loose.
The inscription at the bottom of the two panels reads ""HOC OPUS FIERI FECIT MARTINUS DE NEWENHOVEN ANNO DM 1487 - ANO VERO ETATIS SUE 23"" meaning ""Maarten van Nieuwenhove had this work made in 1487"" (left panel) and ""At the age of 23"" (right panel).

When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, 'Come!' And out came another horse, bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that men should slay one another; and he was given a great sword.

Transforming what was a relatively staid and unthreatening image in earlier illustrated Bibles, Dürer injects motion and danger into this climactic moment through his subtle manipulation of the woodcut. The parallel lines across the image establish a basic middle tone against which the artist silhouettes and overlaps the powerful forms of the four horses and riders—from left to right, Death, Famine, War, and Plague (or Pestilence).

image25,image25.jpg,Self-Portrait in Fur Coat (as Christ),"Dürer, Albrecht (1471-1528)",1500,1500,"The last of Dürer's three magnificent self-portraits was painted early in 1500, before his 29th birthday on 21 May. The picture is proudly inscribed: `Thus I, Albrecht Dürer from Nuremburg, painted myself with indelible colours at the age of 28 years.' It is a sombre image, painted primarily in browns, set against a plain dark background.

The face is striking for its resemblance to the head of Christ. In late medieval art, Jesus was traditionally presented in this manner, looking straight ahead in a symmetrical pose. Christ's brown hair in these images is parted towards the middle and falls over the shoulders. For the first and last time in Western art history, an artist was to portray himself in a Christ-like scheme. Given his idealized appearance as the underdrawing shows, his nose was originally irregular in shape - Dürer is approaching us in ""imitatio Christi"", in imitation of Christ. He has a short beard and moustache. Dürer has even painted himself with brown hair, although the other self-portraits show that it was actually reddish-blond. Dürer deliberately set out to create a Christ- like image, with his hand raised to his chest almost in a pose of blessing. But this was no gesture of arrogance or blasphemy. It was a statement of faith: Christ was the son of God and God had created Man. For Dürer, the painting was an acknowledgment that artistic skills were a God-given talent.

However, Dürer has subtly departed from the traditional image of Christ in his self-portrait. Despite initial appearances, the picture is not quite symmetrical. The head lies just off the centre of the panel to the right and the parting of the hair is not exactly in the middle, with the strands of hair falling a little differently on the two sides. The eyes stare slightly towards the left of the panel. Dürer also wears contemporary clothing, a fashionable fur- lined mantle. The result is a highly personal image, one whose `indelible colours' still influence the way we imagine Dürer looked in his later years.

The deceptive illusionism in which the picture is painted is also, however, a reference to the classical artistic legend about Apelles, with whom he had been compared by contemporary humanists.",,"Munich, Germany",Alte Pinakothek,image/jpeg,"Oil on lime panel, 67,1 x 48,7 cm","""Self-Portrait in Fur Coat (as Christ)"" by the Web Gallery of Art, Emil Krén and Daniel Marx, (https://www.wga.hu/html_m/d/durer/1/03/1self28.html), Public Domain.",48.13541752,11.57994325
image26,image26.jpg,Portrait of Erasmus,"Dürer, Albrecht (1471-1528)",1526,1526,"A Roman Catholic reformer and one the most important Netherlandish humanists, Erasmus of Rotterdam held a deep admiration for Albrecht Dürer, whom he praised in a eulogy as the greatest of graphic artists: ""And is it not more wonderful to accomplish without the blandishment of colors what Apelles accomplished with their aid?"" In likening Dürer to Apelles—indeed, in asserting the German's superiority over the Greek artist—Erasmus echoed a tradition dating back to antiquity of judging artists and the visual character of their work by the standards set by their predecessors. Dürer would certainly have appreciated the praise for his graphic talents. The portrait amply demonstrates the virtuous effects Dürer was able to achieve without the benefit of color or a liquid medium. Convincingly aligned at an angle to the picture plane, Erasmus stands writing in his study, with the books that indicate his substantial intellect and scholarship arranged around him. The vase of lilies probably refers to the purity of his mind, while the Latin and Greek inscription, prominently framed like a picture on the wall, underscores the scholar's humanistic interests: ""This image of Erasmus of Rotterdam was drawn from life by Albrecht Dürer."" Below are the date, 1526, in Roman numerals, and the artist's monogram.
Dürer met Erasmus at least once in Brussels and twice in Rotterdam during a trip to the Netherlands in 1520 and 1521. Although he sketched Erasmus several times during his trip, he did not execute the engraving until six years later, and only then with the encouragement of his close friend Willibald Pirkheimer; apparently, for certain reasons Dürer had been disappointed by the well-known Protestant reformer. Dürer based the portrait on a medal of 1519 in Pirkheimer's collection by Quentin Massys and reproduced the Greek inscription found on the medal, which states: ""A better portrait his writings show."" Presumably Erasmus agreed, because he made known his disappointment with this portrait to at least two of his colleagues. And yet, Dürer's Erasmus remains one of history's richest and most powerful depictions of scholarly preoccupation and the humanist ideal.",,"New York, USA",Metropolitan Museum of Art,image/jpeg,engraving; 9 3/4 x 7 1/2 in.

image34,image34.jpg,Witches Sabbath,"Baldung, Hans (1484/85-1545)",1510,1510,"A masterpiece of German chiaroscuro, this woodcut is one of Hans Baldung Grien's best known prints, produced soon after his move to Strasbourg from Nuremberg, where he had worked as a journeyman with Albrecht Dürer from about 1503 to 1507. Although Baldung was not the inventor of the chiaroscuro woodcut—the credit for this must go to Hans Burgkmair—he was among the very earliest and most effective practitioners of the medium.
The tone block for this woodcut is sometimes printed in an orange-brown, casting a hellish glow onto the scene; here the use of a gray tone block creates an atmosphere of nocturnal gloom from which the three witches emerge, gathered around the steaming cauldron of ""flying unguent."" The flickering highlights, where the white of the paper is exposed, give three-dimensional presence to forms that would otherwise be engulfed by the dark setting and, by continuing the modeling of the dark hatching strokes, powerfully define the volumes of the monumental nudes, the blasted tree, and the solid coils of steam that support the witches as they ascend in the night air.
The interest in witchcraft in the German-speaking countries was especially strong at the beginning of the sixteenth century, heralded by the publication in 1487 of the Malleus Maleficarum (The Witches' Hammer) by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger, which was reprinted fourteen times before 1520.

Like The Peasant Wedding, it is likely that Bruegel intended this painting to have a moral sense rather than simply being an affectionate portrayal of peasant life. Gluttony, lust and anger can all be identified in the picture.The man seated next to the bagpipe player wears a peacock feather in his hat, a symbol of vanity and pride.[4] The occasion for the peasants' revelry is a Saint's day, but dancers turn their backs on the church and pay no attention whatsoever to the image of the Virgin Mary which hangs on the tree.The prominence of the tavern makes it clear that they are preoccupied with material rather than spiritual matters.
